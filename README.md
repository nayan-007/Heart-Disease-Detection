# Heart-Disease-Detection

## Predicting heart disease using Machine Learning

### We're going to take the following approach:

1. Problem Definition
2. Data
3. Evaluation
4. Features
5. Modelling
6. Experimentation
###  Problem Definition
    In a statement,

    Given clinical parameters about a patient, can we predict whether or not they have heart disease?

###  DATA
     The original data came from the Cleavland data from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/heart+Disease
  
     There is also a version of it available on Kaggle. https://www.kaggle.com/ronitf/heart-disease-uci

### Evaluation
     If we can reach 95% accuracy at predicting whether or not a patient has heart disease during the proof of concept, we'll pursue the project.
